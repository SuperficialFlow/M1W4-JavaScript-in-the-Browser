        // Relevant link: https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys?si=oOB2OYliN078Ensg first 30 minutes of the video

        // Todo 2.1 Select the unordered list with the id "subjects-taken"
        // Relevant Link: https://dev.to/alternate_robot/dom-selectors-in-javascript-344i
        
        const select = document.getElementById("subjects-taken")

        // Checkpoint 2.1 What are the other ways to select elements in the DOM?
        // Answer: 
        
        //Several ways in selecting elements in the DOM would through the ID which is the simplest form of having to select single DOM element. Class enables you select multiple DOM elements that share a common attribute. Tag Name is similar to Class, however it specifically uses Tag itself (div, p, h1, and etc). Query Selector selects one item or multiple with the same class name. With some practicalities of an ID, class, or an attribute. Then selects the first one. 

        // Todo 2.2 Set the text of the first list item to "<>"
        
        const listItem = document.getElementsByTagName("li")
        listItem[0].innerText = "<>"

        // Checkpoint 3.2 What is the difference between innerText, textContent, and innerHTML. When should you use one over the other
        // Answer:
        
        //The difference being that innerText enables you to view an element without formatting it. TextContent ignores all html tags and only returns the text. And innerHTML allows you to read both the html tags and text content.

        // Todo 2.3 Create another list item, and add it as a child of the unordered list
        // Relevant Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/How_to_create_a_DOM_tree

        const unList = document.createElement("li")
        unList.innerHTML = "Ethics"
        document.getElementById('subjects-taken').appendChild(unList)

        // Todo 2.4 Set the id attribute of the list item you created to "favorite-subject". Set the class of the list item to "newly-created"
        
        unList.setAttribute('id', 'favorite-subject')
        unList.setAttribute('class', 'newly-created')

        // Todo 2.5 Delete the second list item in the unordered list

        const unList2 = document.querySelectorAll("#subjects-taken li")
        unList2[1].parentNode.removeChild(unList2[1])

        // Checkpoint 2.3 Checkpoint what is the difference between node and element

        //Node is typically present in DOM, which can be considered as any type of DOM object. Where they are organized as a tree-like structure, where the document node would be positioned at the top of all other nodes. Additionally, nodes allows you to configure their properties and methods. Elements on the otherhand, are generally a specific type of node representing a tag in the HTML document. Otherwise, nodes are typically elements within a document would be considered as a node while elements would refer to a tag such as <html>, <body>, and etc. 

        // Bonus Todo 2.6 Select the parent of the unordered list.

        const todo6 = document.getElementById("subjects-taken").parentNode

        // Bonus Todo 2.7 Select the previous sibling of the list item you previously created

        const todo7 = unList.previousElementSibling
